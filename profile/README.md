# fullstack-pw: Home Lab Infrastructure & DevOps Platform

This organization houses the infrastructure, services, and applications that make up the **fullstack.pw** homelab environment - a comprehensive, production-grade platform built on Kubernetes for learning, experimentation, and portfolio demonstration.

## üåê Overview

The **fullstack.pw** platform demonstrates modern DevOps practices and cloud-native architectures in a homelab setting, including:

- **Multi-environment Kubernetes clusters** (dev, staging, production)
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform, Ansible)
- **GitOps workflows** for continuous deployment
- **Observability stack** (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)
- **Self-hosted CI/CD** (GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD runners)
- **Security practices** (Vault, cert-manager, network policies)
- **Custom CI/CD pipelines** (shared workflows for application deployments)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![fullstack.pw Architecture](/fullstack.drawio.svg)

### Physical Infrastructure

The homelab runs on modest but capable hardware:

- **NODE01** (Acer Nitro, i7-4710HQ, 16GB RAM)
- **NODE02** (HP ED800 G3 Mini, i7-7700T, 32GB RAM)
- **Lenovo Legion** (Personal laptop, running ephemeral CI/CD runners)

All nodes run Proxmox VE for virtualization, hosting various VMs and Kubernetes clusters.

### Network Design

- **Cloudflare** provides DNS, CDN, and WAF services for public-facing components
- **HAProxy** load balancer (`k8s.fullstack.pw`) distributes traffic to Kubernetes clusters
- **Internal DNS** server provides name resolution within the homelab environment
- **MetalLB** provides internal load balancing services for Kubernetes

### Kubernetes Clusters

| Cluster | Type     | Purpose                                  | Node(s)               |

| Prod    | K3s      | Production environment                   | k8s-prod              |
| Runners | K3s      | CI/CD pipeline execution                 | Local (Rancher Desktop)|
| Tools   | K3s      | Supporting tools and services            | k8s-tools             |
